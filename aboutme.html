          <p>
            I'm currently learning full-stack web development, primarily through
            The Odin Project and other online resources. Most of my projects
            right now are experimental and a bit messy, as I'm still building my
            skills.

            My goal is to gain a solid understanding of both front-end and
            back-end development, knowing not just how things work, but why they
            work. I also occasionally explore graphic design, though it's more
            of a side interest for now.
